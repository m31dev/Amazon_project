# Amazon_project
A front-end clone of the Amazon website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on practicing responsive web design, layout structuring, and basic interactivity using JavaScript. It replicates core sections such as the homepage, product listings, and shopping cart to strengthen my front-end development skills.
